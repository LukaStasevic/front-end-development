<h1>html and css fundamentals</h1>
<br>

<p>One of HTML's main jobs is to give text structure so that a browser can display an HTML document the way its developer intends. This article explains the way HTML can be used to structure a page of text by adding headings and paragraphs, emphasizing words, creating lists, and more.
Prerequisites: 	Basic HTML familiarity, as covered in Getting started with HTML. </p>
<p>Most structured text consists of headings and paragraphs, whether you are reading a story, a newspaper, a college textbook, a magazine, etc.</p>
<br>
<h3>It's really up to you what the elements involved represent, as long as the hierarchy makes sense. You just need to bear in mind a few best practices as you create such structures:</h3>
<ul>
<li> <p> Preferably, you should use a single  per page—this is the top level heading, and all others sit below this in the hierarchy.</p></li>
<li> <p> Make sure you use the headings in the correct order in the hierarchy. Don't use elements to represent subheadings, followed by  elements to represent sub-subheadings—that doesn't make sense and will lead to weird results.</p></li>
<li> <p> Of the six heading levels available, you should aim to use no more than three per page, unless you feel it is necessary. Documents with many levels (for example, a deep heading hierarchy) become unwieldy and difficult to navigate. On such occasions, it is advisable to spread the content over multiple pages if possible.</p></li>
</ul>
